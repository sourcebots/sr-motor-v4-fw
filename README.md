Motor Board v4 Firmware
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

These instructions assume that you are using a version of Linux, but should also work on BSD-derived OSes (including OS X). Windows users may wish to try [Cygwin][cygwin], create a Linux VM (although flashing the board from a VM may require some thought), or consider their life choices.

* `git` can be found in your distribution's repositories, or [online][git].
* A working C compiler, such as `gcc` or `clang`, also from your distribution's repositories.
* `make`, also from your distribution's repositories.
* The `arm-none-eabi` toolchain. This may be in your distribution's repositories, otherwise download it [from Launchpad][toolchain] and follow the instructions in the README.
* `stm32flash`, which can be found [on Google Code][stm32flash]. After downloading, build and install it:

	$ make
	$ sudo make install

Instructions
------------

1. From a shell, `cd` into the directory where you cloned the repository and download the `libopencm3` submodule:

	$ git submodule update --init

2. Determine your `arm-none-eabi` toolchain prefix, unless it is in your `$PATH`. If you downloaded it from the link above, it will be the path to the `bin` directory of the extracted folder, followed by `arm-none-eabi`.

3. Build `libopencm3`:

	$ cd libopencm3
	$ make PREFIX=<your toolchain prefix>

4. Change back to the project directory and build the firmware:

	$ cd ..
	$ make PREFIX=<your toolchain prefix>

5. Connect the motor board to your machine via USB. The USB Power Light (green, next to the connector) should turn on.

6. Connect the motor board to a power source. The main power light (green, in the middle of the board) should turn on. If using the SR power board, you will have to run a program to turn on the motor rail.

7. Press the firmware button on the side of the motor board with a long thin object.

8. To test connectivity, run the following command, where X is found by running `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`:

	$ stm32flash /dev/ttyUSB<X>

9. Load the firmware onto the motor board:

	$ stm32flash -w mcv4.bin -v /dev/ttyUSB<X>
	
## Controls

The motor board is largely controlled over the serial interface. There is one physical push button on the board that is a firmware reset button.

## USB interface

Unlike other SR v4 boards, the STM32 on the motor board does not directly communicate over USB. Instead there is an FTDI USB serial interface chip.

The FTDI Chip has vendor ID `0403` and product ID `6001`. It can be further filtered by the USB `product` field.

Given that the appropriate drivers are available on your computer, it should appear as a standard serial interface. You should open this interface at a baud rate of `1000000bps`.

### Serial Commands


8 bit commands should be sent over the serial interface to the board.

The following commands are supported:

| Decimal Value | Unicode| Purpose                         |
|---------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| 0             | `\x00` | Reset the STM32                 |
| 1             | `\x01` | Get the firmware version string |
| 2             | `\x02` | Set Motor 0 value               |
| 3             | `\x03` | Set Motor 1 value               |
| 4             | `\x04` | Reset into USB bootloader       |


### Setting Motor Speeds

The value of a motor can be set by sending the appropriate command, and then a second byte as follows:

The argument byte is a standard 8-bit signed number, where a few values are reserved for the special cases of no-op, coast and brake.

| Decimal Value | Purpose         |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 0             | No-op           |
| 1             | Coast the motor |
| 2             | Brake the motor |

### Firmware String

When the firmware string is requested from the motor board, you will receive bytes of the following format over the serial interface: `MCV4B:3\n`.

The number after the colon represents the firmware version of the board.

## udev Rule

If you are connecting the Motor Board to a Linux computer with udev, the following rule can be added in order to access
the Motor Board interface without root privileges:

`SUBSYSTEM=="tty", DRIVERS=="ftdi_sio", ATTRS{interface}=="MCV4B", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0666"`

It should be noted that `plugdev` can be changed to any Unix group of your preference.
